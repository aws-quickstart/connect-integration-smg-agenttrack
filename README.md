## Amazon Connect Integration for VoiceFoundry Post-Call Surveys, powered by SMG AgentTrack

This Quick Start integrates VoiceFoundry Post-Call Survey, powered by SMG AgentTrack, with Amazon Connect. The integration enables contact centers to easily implement and manage post-call surveys and submit them to SMG for aggregation, reporting, and center analysis. The integration deploys two AWS Lambda functions, an Amazon Kinesis stream, and Amazon API Gateway.
